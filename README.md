# dye-helper

Simple keybinds to help operate Technorama's Dosorama 2 program.

Depending on the dye quantities, salt and soda ash values are to be used from an estabilished table. The function to auto calculate said values isn't present on the Dosorama 2 program, therefor this app grabs the already inputed dye values, check if Bio-touch CN/NLG and Indifix PA (auxiliar components) are present, and inputs salt/soda ash values automatically.
